# Creation-of-IP-Intellectual-Property-in-Xilinx-Vivado
An intellectual property core (IP core) is a functional block of logic or data used to make a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) or application-specific integrated circuit(ASIC) for a product. Commonly used in semiconductors, an IP core is a reusable unit of logic or integrated circuit (IC) layout design.
#1. What is an IP Core?

An IP core (Intellectual Property core) is basically a pre-designed, reusable module of logic that implements a specific functionality in FPGA or ASIC designs. Examples: UART, SPI, FIFO, memory controllers, DSP blocks.

#Key Points:

IPs can be custom (created by you) or vendor-provided (Xilinx IP catalog).

IPs simplify complex FPGA design by reusing tested blocks instead of coding from scratch.

IP cores can be parameterized, meaning you can customize data width, frequency, etc.
